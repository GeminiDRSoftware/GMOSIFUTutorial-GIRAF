Sensitivity function
********************

The sensitivity function is calculated from the spectrophotometric standard.

In the interest of time, we will skip the reduction of the star standard since
it is essentially the same steps as for the reduction of the science which we
will cover later.  We refer to ??? appendix ??? for an overview of the
standard reduction steps.

.. todo::  appendix for overview of reduction of std star.


Here we start with an already reduced standard star exposured and we proceed
to demonstrate the two extra steps that will lead the sensitivity function.
